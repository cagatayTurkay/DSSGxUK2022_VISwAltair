# DSSGxUK2022 VIS with Altair

This is a respository to hold the training material for the *Doing Data Visualisation in Python with Altair, A Primer* session within the "Data Science for Social Good" programme at University of Warwick (https://warwick.ac.uk/research/data-science/warwick-data/dssgx/).

The practice material (i.e., notebooks) are based on a combination of material from the Data Science Across Disciplines module delivered at the Centre for Interdisicplinary Methodologies at Wawrwick (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/cim/apply-to-study/cross-disciplinary-postgraduate-modules/im939-data-science-across-disciplines/) and the impressive Altair-based Visualisation Cirriculum developed by University of Washington folks (https://uwdata.github.io/visualization-curriculum/intro.html).
